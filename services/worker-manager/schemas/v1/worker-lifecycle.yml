    type: integer
    description: |
      Each worker in this pool has `registrationTimeout` seconds to
      register itself with worker-manager after it has
      been requsted from the cloud provider. After this
      timeout, worker-manager will terminate the instance,
      assuming it is broken.
  checkinTimeout:

    type: integer

    description: |
      If specified, workers in this pool must re-register via `checkin()`
      within `checkinTimeout` seconds to get new credentials. If the
      worker has not done so, it will be terminated. This defaults
      to 96 hours.
